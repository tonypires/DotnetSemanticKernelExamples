operating results depend upon the Company\u2019s ability to obtain components in sufficient quantities on\ncommercially reasonable terms.\nBecause the Company currently obtains certain components from single or limited sources, the Company is subject to significant\nsupply and pricing risks. Many components, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to\nindustry-wide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations that can materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s\nbusiness, results of operations and financial condition. For example, the global semiconductor industry is experiencing high\ndemand and shortages of supply, which has adversely affected, and could materially adversely affect, the Company\u2019s ability to\nobtain sufficient quantities of components and products on commercially reasonable terms or at all. While the Company has\nentered into agreements for the supply of many components, there can be no assurance the Company will be able to extend or\nrenew these agreements on similar terms, or at all. Component suppliers may suffer from poor financial conditions, which can\r\nlead to business failure for the supplier or consolidation within a particular industry, further limiting the Company\u2019s ability to obtain\nsufficient quantities of components on commercially reasonable terms or at all. The effects of global or regional economic\nconditions on the Company\u2019s suppliers, described in \u201CThe Company\u2019s operations and performance depend significantly on\nglobal and regional economic conditions and adverse economic conditions can materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s\nbusiness, results of operations and financial condition,\u201D above, can also affect the Company\u2019s ability to obtain components.\nTherefore, the Company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases that can materially\nadversely affect its business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company\u2019s new products often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product\nuses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers\u2019 yields have matured or their manufacturing\ncapacities have increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, can be affected for any\r\nnumber of reasons, including if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components\ncustomized to meet the Company\u2019s requirements. When the Company\u2019s supply of components for a new or existing product has\nbeen delayed or constrained, or when an outsourcing partner has delayed shipments of completed products to the Company, the\nCompany\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition have been adversely affected and future delays or constraints\ncould materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition. The Company\u2019s business\nand financial performance could also be materially adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient\nquantities from the source, or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source.\nApple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 9The Company\u2019s products and services may be affected from time to time by design and manufacturing defects that could\nmaterially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business and result in harm to the Company\u2019s reputation. The Company offers complex hardware and software products and services that can be affected by design and manufacturing\ndefects.
