a portion, of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the\nhedges are in place.\nThe Company is exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the values of its investment portfolio.\nThe Company\u2019s investments can be negatively affected by changes in liquidity, credit deterioration, financial results, market and\neconomic conditions, political risk, sovereign risk, interest rate fluctuations or other factors. As a result, the value and liquidity of\nthe Company\u2019s cash, cash equivalents, and marketable and non-marketable securities may fluctuate substantially. Therefore,\nalthough the Company has not realized any significant losses on its cash, cash equivalents, and marketable and non-marketable\nsecurities, future fluctuations in their value could result in significant losses and could have a material adverse impact on the\nCompany\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company is exposed to credit risk on its trade accounts receivable, vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments\nrelated to long-term supply agreements, and this risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen.\r\nThe Company distributes its products through third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers. The\nCompany also sells its products directly to small and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and government\ncustomers. A substantial majority of the Company\u2019s outstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral, third-party bank\nsupport or financing arrangements, or credit insurance, and a significant portion of the Company\u2019s trade receivables can be\nconcentrated within cellular network carriers or other resellers. The Company\u2019s exposure to credit and collectibility risk on its\ntrade receivables is higher in certain international markets and its ability to mitigate such risks may be limited. The Company also\nhas unsecured vendor non-trade receivables resulting from purchases of components by outsourcing partners and other vendors\nthat manufacture subassemblies or assemble final products for the Company. In addition, the Company has made prepayments\nassociated with long-term supply agreements to secure supply of inventory components. As of September\u00A0 25, 2021, the\r\nCompany\u2019s vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements were concentrated among a\nfew individual vendors located primarily in Asia. While the Company has procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk\non its trade and vendor non-trade receivables, as well as long-term prepayments, there can be no assurance such procedures\nwill effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses.\nThe Company is subject to changes in tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation and exposure to\nadditional tax liabilities.\nThe Company is subject to taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions, including Ireland, where a number of the\nCompany\u2019s subsidiaries are organized. Due to economic and political conditions, tax laws and tax rates for income taxes and\nother non-income taxes in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change. The Company\u2019s effective tax rates are\naffected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, the introduction of new taxes, or changes in tax laws or their interpretation, including in the U.S. and\nIreland.\nThe Company is also subject to the examination of its tax returns and other tax matters by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service\nand other tax authorities and governmental bodies. The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of an adverse outcome\n"}}
