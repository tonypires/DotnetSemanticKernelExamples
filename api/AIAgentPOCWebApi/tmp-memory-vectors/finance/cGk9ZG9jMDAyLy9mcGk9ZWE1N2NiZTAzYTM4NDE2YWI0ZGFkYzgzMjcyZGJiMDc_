Employee Stock Plan\nThe 2014 Employee Stock Plan (the \u201C2014 Plan\u201D) is a shareholder-approved plan that provides for broad-based equity grants to\nemployees, including executive officers, and permits the granting of restricted stock units (\u201CRSUs\u201D), stock grants, performance-\nbased awards, stock options and stock appreciation rights, as well as cash bonus awards. RSUs granted under the 2014 Plan\ngenerally vest over four years, based on continued employment, and are settled upon vesting in shares of the Company\u2019s\ncommon stock on a one-for-one basis. RSUs granted under the 2014 Plan reduce the number of shares available for grant under\nthe plan by a factor of two times the number of RSUs granted. RSUs canceled and shares withheld to satisfy tax withholding\nobligations increase the number of shares available for grant under the 2014 Plan utilizing a factor of two times the number of\nRSUs canceled or shares withheld. All RSUs granted under the 2014 Plan have dividend equivalent rights (\u201CDERs\u201D), which\nentitle holders of RSUs to the same dividend value per share as holders of common stock. DERs are subject to the same vesting\r\nand other terms and conditions as the underlying RSUs. As of September\u00A025, 2021, approximately 760 million shares were\nreserved for future issuance under the 2014 Plan. Shares subject to outstanding awards under the 2003 Employee Stock Plan\nthat expire, are canceled or otherwise terminate, or are withheld to satisfy tax withholding obligations for RSUs, will also be\navailable for awards under the 2014 Plan.\nApple Inc. Non-Employee Director Stock Plan\nThe Apple Inc. Non-Employee Director Stock Plan (the \u201CDirector Plan\u201D) is a shareholder-approved plan that (i)\u00A0permits the\nCompany to grant awards of RSUs or stock options to the Company\u2019s non-employee directors, (ii)\u00A0provides for automatic initial\ngrants of RSUs upon a non-employee director joining the Board of Directors and automatic annual grants of RSUs at each\nannual meeting of shareholders, and (iii)\u00A0permits the Board of Directors to prospectively change the value and relative mixture of\nstock options and RSUs for the initial and annual award grants and the methodology for determining the number of shares of the\r\nCompany\u2019s common stock subject to these grants, in each case within the limits set forth in the Director Plan and without further\nshareholder approval. RSUs granted under the Director Plan reduce the number of shares available for grant under the plan by a\nfactor of two times the number of RSUs granted. The Director Plan expires on November 12, 2027. All RSUs granted under the\nDirector Plan are entitled to DERs, which are subject to the same vesting and other terms and conditions as the underlying\nRSUs. As of September\u00A025, 2021, approximately 4 million shares were reserved for future issuance under the Director Plan.\nRule 10b5-1 Trading Plans\nDuring the three months ended September\u00A025, 2021, Section 16 officers Katherine L.
