Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 35The Company presents derivative assets and liabilities at their gross fair values in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The\nCompany classifies cash flows related to derivative instruments as operating activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash\nFlows.\nFair Value Measurements\nThe fair values of the Company\u2019s money market funds and certain marketable equity securities are based on quoted prices in\nactive markets for identical assets. The valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of the Company\u2019s debt instruments\nand all other financial instruments, which generally have counterparties with high credit ratings, are based on quoted market\nprices or model-driven valuations using significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data.\nNote 2 \u2013 Revenue Recognition\nNet sales consist of revenue from the sale of iPhone, Mac, iPad, Services and other products. The Company recognizes revenue\nat the amount to which it expects to be entitled when control of the products or services is transferred to its customers. Control is\r\ngenerally transferred when the Company has a present right to payment and title and the significant risks and rewards of\nownership of products or services are transferred to its customers. For most of the Company\u2019s Products net sales, control\ntransfers when products are shipped. For the Company\u2019s Services net sales, control transfers over time as services are\ndelivered. Payment for Products and Services net sales is collected within a short period following transfer of control or\ncommencement of delivery of services, as applicable.\nThe Company records reductions to Products net sales related to future product returns, price protection and other customer\nincentive programs based on the Company\u2019s expectations and historical experience.\nFor arrangements with multiple performance obligations, which represent promises within an arrangement that are distinct, the\nCompany allocates revenue to all distinct performance obligations based on their relative stand-alone selling prices (\u201CSSPs\u201D).\nWhen available, the Company uses observable prices to determine SSPs. When observable prices are not available, SSPs are\r\nestablished that reflect the Company\u2019s best estimates of what the selling prices of the performance obligations would be if they\nwere sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. The Company\u2019s process for estimating SSPs without observable prices considers\nmultiple factors that may vary depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each performance obligation\nincluding, where applicable, prices charged by the Company for similar offerings, market trends in the pricing for similar offerings,\nproduct-specific business objectives and the estimated cost to provide the performance obligation.\nThe Company has identified up to three performance obligations regularly included in arrangements involving the sale of iPhone,\nMac, iPad and certain other products. The first performance obligation, which represents the substantial portion of the allocated\nsales price, is the hardware and bundled software delivered at the time of sale. The second performance obligation is the right to\nreceive certain product-related bundled services, which include iCloud\u00AE, Siri and Maps. The third performance obligation is the right to receive, on a when-and-if-available basis, future unspecified software upgrades relating to the software bundled with\neach device. The Company allocates revenue and any related discounts to these performance obligations based on their relative\nSSPs. Because the Company lacks observable prices for the undelivered performance obligations, the allocation of revenue is\n"}}
