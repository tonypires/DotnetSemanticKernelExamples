Inc.\r\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nNote 1 \u2013 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation and Preparation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Apple Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries (collectively \u201CApple\u201D\nor the \u201CCompany\u201D). Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. In the opinion of the Company\u2019s\nmanagement, the consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments, which are normal and recurring in nature, necessary\nfor fair financial statement presentation. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in\nconformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that\naffect the amounts reported. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. Certain prior period amounts in the\nconsolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been reclassified to conform to the current period\u2019s\npresentation.\nThe Company\u2019s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company\u2019s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters. The\nCompany\u2019s fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019 spanned 52 weeks each. Unless otherwise stated, references to particular years,\n"}}
