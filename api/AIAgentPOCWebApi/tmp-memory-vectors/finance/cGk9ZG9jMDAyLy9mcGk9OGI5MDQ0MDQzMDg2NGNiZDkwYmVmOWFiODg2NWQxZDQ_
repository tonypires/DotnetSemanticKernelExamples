Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure\nNone.\nItem 9A. Controls and Procedures\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nBased on an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of the Company\u2019s management, the Company\u2019s principal\nexecutive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that the Company\u2019s disclosure controls and procedures as defined\r\nin Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act were effective as of September\u00A025, 2021 to provide reasonable\nassurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is\n(i)\u00A0 recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms and\n(ii)\u00A0 accumulated and communicated to the Company\u2019s management, including its principal executive officer and principal\nfinancial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nInherent Limitations over Internal Controls\nThe Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of\nfinancial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted\naccounting principles (\u201CGAAP\u201D). The Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures\nthat:\u00A0\n(i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and\ndispositions of the Company\u2019s assets;\r\n(ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial\nstatements in accordance with GAAP, and that the Company\u2019s receipts and expenditures are being made only in\naccordance with authorizations of the Company\u2019s management and directors; and\n(iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or\ndisposition of the Company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nManagement, including the Company\u2019s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that the Company\u2019s\ninternal controls will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can\nprovide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a\ncontrol system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative\nto their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of internal controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. Also, any evaluation of the effectiveness of\ncontrols in future periods are subject to the risk that those internal controls may become inadequate because of changes in\n"}}
