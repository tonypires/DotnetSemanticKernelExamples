this area, and additional jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions or have laws that are pending. These\nlaws continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Complying with emerging and changing\nrequirements causes the Company to incur substantial costs and has required and may in the future require the Company to\nchange its business practices. Noncompliance could result in significant penalties or legal liability.\nThe Company makes statements about its use and disclosure of personal information through its privacy policy, information\nprovided on its website, press statements and other privacy notices provided to customers. Any failure by the Company to\ncomply with these public statements or with other federal, state or international privacy or data protection laws and regulations\ncould result in inquiries or proceedings against the Company by governmental entities or others. In addition to reputational\nimpacts, penalties could include ongoing audit requirements and significant legal liability.\r\nIn addition to the risks generally relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of personal information, the\nCompany is also subject to specific obligations relating to information considered sensitive under applicable laws, such as health\ndata, financial data and biometric data.

For example,\nthe gross margins on the Company\u2019s products and services vary significantly and can change over time. The Company\u2019s gross\nmargins are subject to volatility and downward pressure due to a variety of factors, including: continued industry-wide global\nproduct pricing pressures and product pricing actions that the Company may take in response to such pressures; increased\ncompetition; the Company\u2019s ability to effectively stimulate demand for certain of its products and services; compressed product life cycles; potential increases in the cost of components, outside manufacturing services, and developing, acquiring and\ndelivering content for the Company\u2019s services; the Company\u2019s ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively;\nshifts in the mix of products and services, or in the geographic, currency or channel mix, including to the extent that regulatory\n"}}
