As with all companies, these security measures may not be sufficient for all\neventualities and may be vulnerable to hacking, ransomware attacks, employee error, malfeasance, system error, faulty\npassword management or other irregularities. For example, third parties can fraudulently induce the Company\u2019s or its vendors\u2019\nemployees or customers into disclosing user names, passwords or other sensitive information, which can, in turn, be used for\nunauthorized access to the Company\u2019s or its vendors\u2019 systems and services. To help protect customers and the Company, the\nCompany deploys and makes available technologies like multifactor authentication, monitors its services and systems for\nunusual activity and may freeze accounts under suspicious circumstances, which, among other things, can result in the delay or\nloss of customer orders or impede customer access to the Company\u2019s products and services.\nWhile the Company maintains insurance coverage that is intended to address certain aspects of data security risks, such\ninsurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise.\r\nApple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 12Investment in new business strategies and acquisitions could disrupt the Company\u2019s ongoing business, present risks not\noriginally contemplated and adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations and financial\ncondition.\nThe Company has invested, and in the future may invest, in new business strategies or acquisitions. Such endeavors may\ninvolve significant risks and uncertainties, including distraction of management from current operations, greater-than-expected\nliabilities and expenses, economic, political, legal and regulatory challenges associated with operating in new businesses,\nregions or countries, inadequate return on capital, potential impairment of tangible and intangible assets, and significant write-\noffs. Investment and acquisition transactions are exposed to additional risks, including failing to obtain required regulatory\napprovals on a timely basis or at all, or the imposition of onerous conditions that could delay or prevent the Company from\ncompleting a transaction or otherwise limit the Company\u2019s ability to fully realize the anticipated benefits of a transaction. These\r\nnew ventures are inherently risky and may not be successful. The failure of any significant investment could adversely affect the\nCompany\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company\u2019s retail stores have required and will continue to require a substantial investment and commitment of\nresources and are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties.\nThe Company\u2019s retail stores have required substantial investment in equipment and leasehold improvements, information\nsystems, inventory and personnel. The Company also has entered into substantial lease commitments for retail space. Certain\nstores have been designed and built to serve as high-profile venues to promote brand awareness. Because of their unique\ndesign elements, locations and size, these stores require substantially more investment than the Company\u2019s more typical retail\nstores. Due to the high cost structure associated with the Company\u2019s retail stores, a decline in sales or the closure or poor\nperformance of an individual store or multiple stores, including as a result of protective public safety measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, could result in significant lease termination costs, write-offs of equipment and leasehold improvements and\nseverance costs.\nThe Company\u2019s retail operations are subject to many factors that pose risks and uncertainties and could adversely impact the\nCompany\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition, including macro-economic factors that could have an adverse\n"}}
