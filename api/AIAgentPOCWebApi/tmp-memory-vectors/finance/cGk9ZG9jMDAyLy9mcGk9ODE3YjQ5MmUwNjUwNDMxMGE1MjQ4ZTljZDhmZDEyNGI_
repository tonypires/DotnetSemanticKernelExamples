including pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and other events beyond the Company\u2019s control. Global climate\nchange is resulting in certain types of natural disasters occurring more frequently or with more intense effects. Such events can\nmake it difficult or impossible for the Company to manufacture and deliver products to its customers, create delays and\ninefficiencies in the Company\u2019s supply and manufacturing chain, and result in slowdowns and outages to the Company\u2019s service\nofferings. Following an interruption to its business, the Company can require substantial recovery time, experience significant\nexpenditures to resume operations, and lose significant sales. Because the Company relies on single or limited sources for the\nsupply and manufacture of many critical components, a business interruption affecting such sources would exacerbate any\nnegative consequences to the Company.\nThe Company\u2019s operations are also subject to the risks of industrial accidents at its suppliers and contract manufacturers. While\nthe Company\u2019s suppliers are required to maintain safe working environments and operations, an industrial accident could occur\r\nand could result in disruption to the Company\u2019s business and harm to the Company\u2019s reputation. Major public health issues,\nincluding pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, have adversely affected, and could in the future adversely affect, the\nCompany due to their impact on the global economy and demand for consumer products; the imposition of protective public\nsafety measures, such as stringent employee travel restrictions and limitations on freight services and the movement of products\nbetween regions; and disruptions in the Company\u2019s supply chain and sales and distribution channels, resulting in interruptions of\nthe supply of current products and delays in production ramps of new products.\nWhile the Company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of losses, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to\ncover all losses that may arise.\nApple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 7Global markets for the Company\u2019s products and services are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological\nchange, and the Company may be unable to compete effectively in these markets.\nThe Company\u2019s products and services are offered in highly competitive global markets characterized by aggressive price\r\ncompetition and resulting downward pressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products and services, short\nproduct life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in product price and performance characteristics, rapid\nadoption of technological advancements by competitors, and price sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of innovative\nnew products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company designs and develops nearly the entire solution for\nits products, including the hardware, operating system, numerous software applications and related services. As a result, the\nCompany must make significant investments in R\u0026D. There can be no assurance these investments will achieve expected\nreturns, and the Company may not be able to develop and market new products and services successfully.\nThe Company currently holds a significant number of patents, trademarks and copyrights and has registered, and applied to register, additional patents, trademarks and copyrights. In contrast, many of the Company\u2019s competitors seek to compete\nprimarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures, and by imitating the Company\u2019s products and infringing on\n"}}
