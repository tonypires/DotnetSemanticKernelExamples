Warranty and Guarantees\nThe following table shows changes in the Company\u2019s accrued warranties and related costs for 2021, 2020 and 2019 (in millions):\n2021 2020 2019\nBeginning accrued warranty

The iPhone Upgrade Program provides customers the right to trade in that iPhone for a specified\namount when purchasing a new iPhone, provided certain conditions are met. The Company accounts for the trade-in right as a\nguarantee liability and recognizes arrangement revenue net of the fair value of such right, with subsequent changes to the\nguarantee liability recognized within net sales.\nConcentrations in the Available Sources of Supply of Materials and Product\nAlthough most components essential to the Company\u2019s business are generally available from multiple sources, certain\r\ncomponents are currently obtained from single or limited sources. The Company also competes for various components with\nother participants in the markets for smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and accessories. Therefore, many\ncomponents used by the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide\nshortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations.\nThe Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced by\nthe Company often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new\ntechnologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers\u2019 yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have\nincreased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if suppliers decide to\nconcentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company\u2019s requirements.\nThe Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components; however, there can be no guarantee that the\r\nCompany will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all.\nSubstantially all of the Company\u2019s hardware products are manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located primarily in\nAsia, with some Mac computers manufactured in the U.S. and Ireland.\nUnconditional Purchase Obligations\nThe Company has entered into certain off\u2013balance sheet commitments that require the future purchase of goods or services\n(\u201Cunconditional purchase obligations\u201D). The Company\u2019s unconditional purchase obligations primarily consist of payments for\ncontent creation, Internet and telecommunications services and supplier arrangements. Future payments under noncancelable\nunconditional purchase obligations having a remaining term in excess of one year as of September\u00A025, 2021, are as follows (in\nmillions):\n2022 $ 4,551\n2023 2,165\n2024 984\n2025 405\n2026 51\nThereafter 28\nTotal $ 8,184\nApple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 48Contingencies\nThe Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and that have not been fully resolved.
