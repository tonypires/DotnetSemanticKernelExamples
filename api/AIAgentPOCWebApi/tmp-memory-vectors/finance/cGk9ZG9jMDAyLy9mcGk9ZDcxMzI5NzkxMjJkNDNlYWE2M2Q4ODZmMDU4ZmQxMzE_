for the period June 2003 through December 2014. Irish legislative changes, effective as of January 2015, eliminated\nthe application of the tax opinions from that date forward. The recovery amount was calculated to be \u20AC13.1 billion, plus interest of\n\u20AC1.2 billion. The Company and Ireland appealed the State Aid Decision to the General Court of the Court of Justice of the\nEuropean Union (the \u201CGeneral Court\u201D). On July 15, 2020, the General Court annulled the State Aid Decision. On September 25,\n2020, the European Commission appealed the General Court\u2019s decision to the European Court of Justice. The Company\nbelieves that any incremental Irish corporate income taxes potentially due related to the State Aid Decision would be creditable\nagainst U.S. taxes, subject to any foreign tax credit limitations in the Act.\nOn an annual basis, the Company may request approval from the Irish Minister for Finance to reduce the recovery amount for\ncertain taxes paid to other countries. As of September\u00A025, 2021, the adjusted recovery amount was \u20AC12.7 billion, excluding\ninterest. The adjusted recovery amount plus interest is funded into escrow, where it will remain restricted from general use\r\npending the conclusion of all legal proceedings. Refer to the Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities section of Note\n3, \u201CFinancial Instruments\u201D for more information.\nNote 6 \u2013 Leases\nThe Company has lease arrangements for certain equipment and facilities, including retail, corporate, manufacturing and data\ncenter space. These leases typically have original terms not exceeding 10 years and generally contain multiyear renewal\noptions, some of which are reasonably certain of exercise. The Company\u2019s lease arrangements may contain both lease and\nnonlease components. The Company has elected to combine and account for lease and nonlease components as a single lease\ncomponent for leases of retail, corporate, and data center facilities.\nPayments under the Company\u2019s lease arrangements may be fixed or variable, and variable lease payments are primarily based\non purchases of output of the underlying leased assets. Lease costs associated with fixed payments on the Company\u2019s operating\nleases were $1.7 billion and $1.5 billion for 2021 and 2020, respectively. Lease costs associated with variable payments on the\r\nCompany\u2019s leases were $12.9 billion and $9.3 billion for 2021 and 2020, respectively. Rent expense for operating leases, as\npreviously reported under former lease accounting standards, was $1.3\u00A0billion in 2019.\nThe Company made $1.4 billion and $1.5 billion of fixed cash payments related to operating leases in 2021 and 2020,\nrespectively. Noncash activities involving right-of-use (\u201CROU\u201D) assets obtained in exchange for lease liabilities were $3.3 billion\nfor 2021 and $10.5 billion for 2020, including the impact of adopting FASB ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) in the first\nquarter of 2020.\nThe following table shows ROU assets and lease liabilities, and the associated financial statement line items, as of\nSeptember\u00A025, 2021 and September\u00A026, 2020 (in millions):\nLease-Related Assets and Liabilities Financial Statement Line Items 2021 2020\nRight-of-use assets:\nOperating leases Other non-current assets $ 10,087 $ 8,570\nFinance leases Property, plant and equipment, net 861  629\nTotal right-of-use assets $ 10,948 $ 9,199\nLease liabilities:\nOperating leases Other current liabilities $ 1,449 $ 1,436 Other non-current liabilities 9,506  7,745\nFinance leases Other current liabilities 79  24\nOther non-current liabilities 769  637\nTotal lease liabilities $ 11,803 $ 9,842\nApple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 43Lease liability maturities as of September\u00A025, 2021, are as follows (in millions):\nOperating\nLeases\nFinance\nLeases Total\n2022 $ 1,629 $ 104 $ 1,733\n2023 1,560  123  1,683\n2024 1,499  99  1,598\n"}}
