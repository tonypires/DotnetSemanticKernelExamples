not been fully resolved. The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. When a loss related to a legal proceeding or claim\nis probable and reasonably estimable, the Company accrues its best estimate for the ultimate resolution of the matter. If one or\nmore legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts above management\u2019s expectations, the\nCompany\u2019s financial condition and operating results for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected. In the\nopinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a\nmaterial loss greater than a recorded accrual, concerning loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims, except for the\nfollowing matters:\nVirnetX\nVirnetX, Inc. (\u201CVirnetX\u201D) filed a lawsuit against the Company alleging that certain of the Company\u2019s products infringe on patents\nowned by VirnetX. On April 11, 2018, a jury returned a verdict against the Company in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern\nDistrict of Texas (the \u201CEastern Texas District Court\u201D). The Company appealed the verdict to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the\r\nFederal Circuit, which remanded the case back to the Eastern Texas District Court, where a retrial was held in October 2020.\nThe jury returned a verdict against the Company and awarded damages of $503 million, which the Company has appealed. The\nCompany has challenged the validity of the patents at issue in the retrial at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (the \u201CPTO\u201D),\nand the PTO has declared the patents invalid, subject to further appeal by VirnetX.\niOS Performance Management Cases\nOn April 5, 2018, several U.S. federal actions alleging violation of consumer protection laws, fraud, computer intrusion and other\ncauses of action related to the Company\u2019s performance management feature used in its iPhone operating systems, introduced to\ncertain iPhones in iOS updates 10.2.1 and 11.2, were consolidated through a Multidistrict Litigation process into a single action in\nthe U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (the \u201CNorthern California District Court\u201D). On February 28, 2020, the\nparties in the Multidistrict Litigation reached a settlement to resolve the U.S. federal and California state class actions. On March\r\n18, 2021, the Northern California District Court granted final approval of the Multidistrict Litigation settlement, which will result in\nan aggregate payment of $310 million to settle all claims. The Company continues to believe that its iPhones were not defective,\nthat the performance management feature introduced with iOS updates 10.2.1 and 11.2 was intended to, and did, improve\ncustomers\u2019 user experience, and that the Company did not make any misleading statements or fail to disclose any material\ninformation.\nFrench Competition Authority\nOn March 16, 2020, the French Competition Authority (\u201CFCA\u201D) announced its decision that aspects of the Company\u2019s sales and\ndistribution practices in France violate French competition law, and issued a fine of \u20AC1.1 billion. The Company strongly disagrees\nwith the FCA\u2019s decision, and has appealed.\nOptis\nOptis Wireless Technology, LLC and related entities (\u201COptis\u201D) filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of\nTexas against the Company alleging that certain of the Company\u2019s products infringe on patents owned by Optis. On August 11, 2020, a jury returned a verdict against the Company and awarded damages. In post-trial proceedings, the damages portion of\nthe verdict was set aside. A retrial on damages was held in August 2021 and the jury in that proceeding awarded damages of\n"}}
