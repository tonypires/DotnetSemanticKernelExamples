ramp-up issues, the availability of application software for the Company\u2019s products, the effective management of\npurchase commitments and inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand, the availability of products in appropriate\nquantities and at expected costs to meet anticipated demand, and the risk that new products and services may have quality or\nother defects or deficiencies. There can be no assurance the Company will successfully manage future introductions and\ntransitions of products and services.\nApple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 8The Company depends on component and product manufacturing and logistical services provided by outsourcing\npartners, many of which are located outside of the U.S.\nSubstantially all of the Company\u2019s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in\nAsia. A significant concentration of this manufacturing is currently performed by a small number of outsourcing partners, often in\nsingle locations. The Company has also outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management. While these\r\narrangements can lower operating costs, they also reduce the Company\u2019s direct control over production and distribution. Such\ndiminished control has from time to time and may in the future have an adverse effect on the quality or quantity of products\nmanufactured or services provided, or adversely affect the Company\u2019s flexibility to respond to changing conditions. Although\narrangements with these partners may contain provisions for product defect expense reimbursement, the Company generally\nremains responsible to the consumer for warranty and out-of-warranty service in the event of product defects and experiences an\nunanticipated product defect liability from time to time. While the Company relies on its partners to adhere to its supplier code of\nconduct, violations of the supplier code of conduct occur from time to time and can materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s\nbusiness, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company relies on single-source outsourcing partners in the U.S., Asia and Europe to supply and manufacture many\ncomponents, and on outsourcing partners primarily located in Asia, for final assembly of substantially all of the Company\u2019s\r\nhardware products. Any failure of these partners to perform can have a negative impact on the Company\u2019s cost or supply of\ncomponents or finished goods. In addition, manufacturing or logistics in these locations or transit to final destinations can be\ndisrupted for a variety of reasons, including natural and man-made disasters, information technology system failures, commercial\ndisputes, military actions, economic, business, labor, environmental, public health or political issues, or international trade\ndisputes.\nThe Company has invested in manufacturing process equipment, much of which is held at certain of its outsourcing partners,\nand has made prepayments to certain of its suppliers associated with long-term supply agreements. While these arrangements\nhelp ensure the supply of components and finished goods, if these outsourcing partners or suppliers experience severe financial\nproblems or other disruptions in their business, such continued supply can be reduced or terminated, and the recoverability of\nmanufacturing process equipment or prepayments can be negatively impacted. Future operating results depend upon the Company\u2019s ability to obtain components in sufficient quantities on\ncommercially reasonable terms.\nBecause the Company currently obtains certain components from single or limited sources, the Company is subject to significant\nsupply and pricing risks. Many components, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to\n"}}
