particular series of debt securities does not necessarily constitute an event of\ndefault for any other series of debt securities issued under the Indentures.\nWe are required to furnish the trustee annually within 120 days after the end of our fiscal year a statement\r\nby one of our officers to the effect that, to the best knowledge of such officer, we are not in default in the fulfillment of\nany of our obligations under the applicable Indenture or, if there has been a default in the fulfillment of any such\nobligation, specifying each such default and the nature and status thereof.\nNo holder of any debt securities of any series will have any right to institute any judicial or other proceeding\nwith respect to the applicable Indenture, or for the appointment of a

available to the trustee with respect to the debt securities of that series or exercising any trust or power\nconferred to the trustee, and to waive certain defaults. Each of the Indentures provides that if an event of default\noccurs and is continuing, the trustee will exercise such of its rights and powers under such Indenture, and use the\nsame degree of care and skill in their exercise, as a prudent person would exercise or use under the circumstances in\nthe conduct of such person\u2019s own affairs.
