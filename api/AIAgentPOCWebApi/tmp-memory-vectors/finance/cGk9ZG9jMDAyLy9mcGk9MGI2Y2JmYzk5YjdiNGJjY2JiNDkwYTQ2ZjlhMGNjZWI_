pandemic, could result in significant lease termination costs, write-offs of equipment and leasehold improvements and\nseverance costs.\nThe Company\u2019s retail operations are subject to many factors that pose risks and uncertainties and could adversely impact the\nCompany\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition, including macro-economic factors that could have an adverse\neffect on general retail activity. Other factors include the Company\u2019s ability to: manage costs associated with retail store\nconstruction and operation; manage relationships with existing retail partners; manage costs associated with fluctuations in the\nvalue of retail inventory; and obtain and renew leases in quality retail locations at a reasonable cost.\nLegal and Regulatory Compliance Risks\nThe Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted by unfavorable\nresults of legal proceedings or government investigations.\nThe Company is subject to various claims, legal proceedings and government investigations that have arisen in the ordinary\r\ncourse of business and have not yet been fully resolved, and new matters may arise in the future. In addition, agreements\nentered into by the Company sometimes include indemnification provisions which can subject the Company to costs and\ndamages in the event of a claim against an indemnified third party. The number of claims, legal proceedings and government\ninvestigations involving the Company, and the alleged magnitude of such claims, proceedings and government investigations,\nhas generally increased over time and may continue to increase.\nThe Company has faced and continues to face a significant number of patent claims relating to its cellular-enabled products, and\nnew claims may arise in the future. For example, technology and other patent-holding companies frequently assert their patents\nand seek royalties and often enter into litigation based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual\nproperty rights. The Company is vigorously defending infringement actions in courts in several U.S. jurisdictions, as well as\ninternationally in various countries. The plaintiffs in these actions frequently seek injunctions and substantial damages.\r\nRegardless of the merit of particular claims, defending against litigation or responding to government investigations can be\nexpensive, time-consuming, disruptive to the Company\u2019s operations and distracting to management. In recognition of these\nconsiderations, the Company may enter into agreements or other arrangements to settle litigation and resolve such challenges.\nThere can be no assurance such agreements can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur. These\nagreements can also significantly increase the Company\u2019s cost of sales and operating expenses and require the Company to\nchange its business practices and limit the Company\u2019s ability to offer certain products and services.\nExcept as described in Part I, Item 3 of this Form 10-K under the heading \u201CLegal Proceedings\u201D and in Part II, Item 8 of this Form\n10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 10, \u201CCommitments and Contingencies\u201D under the heading\n\u201CContingencies,\u201D in the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss greater than a recorded accrual, concerning loss contingencies for asserted legal and other\nclaims.\n"}}
