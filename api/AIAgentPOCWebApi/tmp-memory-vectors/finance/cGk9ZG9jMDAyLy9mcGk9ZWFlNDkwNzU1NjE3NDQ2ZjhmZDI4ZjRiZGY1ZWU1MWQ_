are measured using the first-in, first-out method.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment\nDepreciation on property, plant and equipment is recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets,\nwhich for buildings is the lesser of 40 years or the remaining life of the building; between one and five years for machinery and\nequipment, including product tooling and manufacturing process equipment; and the shorter of lease term or useful life for\nleasehold improvements. Capitalized costs related to internal-use software are amortized on a straight-line basis over the\nestimated useful lives of the assets, which range from five to seven years. Depreciation and amortization expense on property\nand equipment was $9.5 billion, $9.7 billion and $11.3 billion during 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nNoncash investing activities involving property, plant and equipment resulted in a net decrease to accounts payable and other\ncurrent liabilities of $2.9 billion during 2019.\nRestricted Cash and Restricted Marketable Securities\nThe Company considers cash and marketable securities to be restricted when withdrawal or general use is legally restricted. The\r\nCompany reports restricted cash as other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, and determines current or non-current\nclassification based on the expected duration of the restriction. The Company reports restricted marketable securities as current\nor non-current marketable securities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets based on the classification of the underlying securities.\nDerivative Instruments and Hedging\nAll derivative instruments are recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. The accounting treatment for derivative\ngains and losses is based on intended use and hedge designation.\nGains and losses arising from amounts that are included in the assessment of cash flow hedge effectiveness are initially deferred\nin accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) (\u201CAOCI\u201D) and subsequently reclassified into earnings when the hedged\ntransaction affects earnings, and in the same line item in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. For options designated as\ncash flow hedges, the Company excludes time value from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognizes it on a\r\nstraight-line basis over the life of the hedge in the Consolidated Statements of Operations line item to which the hedge relates.\nChanges in the fair value of amounts excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness are recognized in OCI.\nGains and losses arising from amounts that are included in the assessment of fair value hedge effectiveness are recognized in\nthe Consolidated Statements of Operations line item to which the hedge relates along with offsetting losses and gains related to\nthe change in value of the hedged item. For foreign exchange forward contracts designated as fair value hedges, the Company\nexcludes the forward carry component from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognizes it in OI\u0026E on a straight-line\nbasis over the life of the hedge. Changes in the fair value of amounts excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness are\nrecognized in OCI.\nGains and losses arising from changes in the fair values of derivative instruments that are not designated as accounting hedges\nare recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations line items to which the derivative instruments relate.
