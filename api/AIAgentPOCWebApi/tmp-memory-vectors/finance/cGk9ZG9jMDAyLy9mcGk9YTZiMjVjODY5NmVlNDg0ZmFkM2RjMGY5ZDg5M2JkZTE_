tax assets and liabilities reflect the effects of tax credits and the future income tax effects of temporary differences\nbetween the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases,\nand are measured using enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are\nexpected to be recovered or settled. The Company has elected to record certain deferred tax assets and liabilities in connection\nwith the minimum tax on certain foreign earnings created by the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the \u201CAct\u201D).\nAs of September\u00A025, 2021, the Company had $2.6\u00A0billion in foreign tax credit carryforwards in Ireland and $1.6\u00A0billion in\nCalifornia research and development credit carryforwards, both of which can be carried forward indefinitely. A valuation\nallowance has been recorded for the tax credit carryforwards and a portion of other temporary differences.\nUncertain Tax Positions\nAs of September\u00A025, 2021, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $15.5 billion, of which $6.6 billion, if\r\nrecognized, would impact the Company\u2019s effective tax rate. As of September\u00A026, 2020, the total amount of gross unrecognized\ntax benefits was $16.5 billion, of which $8.8 billion, if recognized, would have impacted the Company\u2019s effective tax rate.\nThe aggregate change in the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits, which excludes interest and penalties, for 2021, 2020\nand 2019, is as follows (in millions):\n2021 2020 2019\nBeginning balances $ 16,475 $ 15,619 $ 9,694\nIncreases related to tax positions taken during a prior year 816  454  5,845\nDecreases related to tax positions taken during a prior year (1,402)  (791)  (686)\nIncreases related to tax positions taken during the current year 1,607  1,347  1,697\nDecreases related to settlements with taxing authorities (1,838)  (85)  (852)\nDecreases related to expiration of the statute of limitations (181)  (69)  (79)\nEnding balances $ 15,477 $ 16,475 $ 15,619\nThe Company is subject to taxation and files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and many state and foreign\njurisdictions. Tax years after 2015 for the U.S. federal jurisdiction, and after 2014 in certain major foreign jurisdictions, remain\r\nsubject to examination. Although the timing of resolution and/or closure of examinations is not certain, the Company believes it is\nreasonably possible that its gross unrecognized tax benefits could decrease in the next 12 months by as much as $1.2\u00A0billion.\nApple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 42Interest and Penalties\nThe Company includes interest and penalties related to income tax matters within the provision for income taxes. As of\nSeptember\u00A025, 2021 and September\u00A026, 2020, the total amount of gross interest and penalties accrued was $1.5 billion and $1.4\nbillion, respectively.

The State Aid Decision ordered Ireland to calculate and recover additional taxes from the Company for the period June 2003 through December 2014. Irish legislative changes, effective as of January 2015, eliminated\nthe application of the tax opinions from that date forward. The recovery amount was calculated to be \u20AC13.1 billion, plus interest of\n\u20AC1.2 billion.
