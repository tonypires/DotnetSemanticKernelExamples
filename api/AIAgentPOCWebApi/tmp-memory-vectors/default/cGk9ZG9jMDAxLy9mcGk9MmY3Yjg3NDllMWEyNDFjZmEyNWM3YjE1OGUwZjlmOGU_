Last Hope\nThe Cylons were relentless. They had hunted down the human survivors across the galaxy,\ndestroying their ships and colonies with their superior firepower and technology. They had a\nplan, and they would not stop until they had wiped out the last remnants of their creators.\nBut the humans had a hope. A hope that was born from a prophecy, a legend, a myth. A hope\nthat there was a thirteenth colony, a lost world that had been the original home of humanity. A\nhope that they could find Earth.\nThe only thing standing between them and their destiny was the Battlestar Galactica, an old\nwarship that had survived the first Cylon war and the surprise attack that had decimated the\nhuman fleet. Led by Commander William Adama, a veteran of the first war, and President Laura\nRoslin, a former secretary of education who had assumed office after the death of the previous\npresident, the Galactica protected a ragtag fleet of civilian ships that carried the last 50,000\nhumans in existence.\r\nAlong the way, they faced many challenges and enemies, both external and internal. They had to\ndeal with Cylon infiltrators who looked and acted like humans, some of whom even believed they\nwere human. They had to cope with dwindling resources, political unrest, religious conflicts, and\npersonal dramas. They had to make difficult decisions that tested their morals and ethics. They\nhad to fight for their survival and their freedom.\nBut they also found allies and friends, both among themselves and among other races. They\ndiscovered new worlds and new mysteries. They learned more about their history and their\ndestiny. They witnessed miracles and wonders. They found love and faith.\nThey never gave up on their quest for Earth, even when it seemed hopeless or impossible. They\nnever gave up on each other, even when they disagreed or betrayed. They never gave up on\nthemselves, even when they doubted or feared.\nThey were the last hope of humanity. And they were not alone."}}
