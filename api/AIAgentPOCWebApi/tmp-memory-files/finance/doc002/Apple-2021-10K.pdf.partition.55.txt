Note 11 – Segment Information and Geographic Data
The Company reports segment information based on the “management” approach. The management approach designates the
internal reporting used by management for making decisions and assessing performance as the source of the Company’s
reportable segments.
The Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company’s reportable segments consist of the
Americas, Europe, Greater China, Japan and Rest of Asia Pacific. Americas includes both North and South America. Europe
includes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East and Africa. Greater China includes China mainland, Hong Kong
and Taiwan. Rest of Asia Pacific includes Australia and those Asian countries not included in the Company’s other reportable
segments. Although the reportable segments provide similar hardware and software products and similar services, each one is
managed separately to better align with the location of the Company’s customers and distribution partners and the unique market
dynamics of each geographic region. The accounting policies of the various segments are the same as those described in Note
1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.”
Apple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 49The Company evaluates the performance of its reportable segments based on net sales and operating income. Net sales for
geographic segments are generally based on the location of customers and sales through the Company’s retail stores located in
those geographic locations. Operating income for each segment includes net sales to third parties, related cost of sales and
operating expenses directly attributable to the segment. Advertising expenses are generally included in the geographic segment
in which the expenditures are incurred. Operating income for each segment excludes other income and expense and certain
expenses managed outside the reportable segments. Costs excluded from segment operating income include various corporate
expenses such as research and development, corporate marketing expenses, certain share-based compensation expenses,
income taxes, various nonrecurring charges and other separately managed general and administrative costs. The Company
does not include intercompany transfers between segments for management reporting purposes.
