majority of the shares required to constitute a quorum.
In an election of directors where the number of nominees exceeds the number of directors to be elected, the
candidates receiving the highest number of affirmative votes of the shares entitled to be voted for them up to the
number of directors to be elected by such shares will be elected.
The Company’s entire Board of Directors or any individual director may be removed without cause by an
affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote, subject to the provisions of the Company’s
Bylaws.
Vacancies created by the removal of a director must be filled only by approval of the shareholders, or by the
unanimous written consent of all shares entitled to vote. The shareholders may elect a director at any time to fill a
vacancy not filled by the directors, but any such election by written consent, other than to fill a vacancy created by
removal, requires the consent of a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote thereon.
An amendment of the Bylaws or the Articles may be adopted by the vote of the majority of the outstanding
shares entitled to vote. Any amendment of the Bylaws specifying or changing a fixed number of directors or the
maximum or minimum number or changing from a fixed to a variable board or vice versa may only be adopted by the
shareholders; provided, however, that an amendment of the Bylaws or the Articles reducing the fixed number or the
minimum number of directors to less than five cannot be adopted if the votes cast against its adoption are equal to
more than 16 2/3% of the outstanding shares entitled to vote.
Exhibit 4.1Any shareholders’ meeting may be adjourned from time to time by the vote of a majority of the shares
present in person or represented by proxy.

Right to Receive Liquidation Distributions
Upon liquidation, dissolution or winding-up, the holders of shares of Common Stock are entitled to receive
pro rata all assets remaining available for distribution to holders of such shares.
No Preemptive or Similar Rights
Common Stock has no preemptive or other subscription rights, and there are no conversion rights or
redemption or sinking fund provisions with respect to such shares of Common Stock.
Anti-Takeover Provisions of the Articles, Bylaws and California Law
Provisions of the Articles and Bylaws may delay or discourage transactions involving an actual or potential
change in control of the Company or change in its management, including transactions in which shareholders might
otherwise receive a premium for their shares, or transactions that its shareholders might otherwise deem to be in their
best interests. Among other things, the Articles and Bylaws:
• provide that, except for a vacancy caused by the removal of a director as provided in the Bylaws, a
vacancy on the Company’s Board of Directors may be filled by a person selected by a majority of the
remaining directors then in office, whether or not less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director;
• provide that shareholders seeking to present proposals before a meeting of shareholders or to nominate
candidates for election as directors at a meeting of shareholders must provide notice in writing in a timely manner, and also specify requirements as to the form and content of a shareholder’s notice;
• provide that a shareholder, or group of up to 20 shareholders, that has owned continuously for at least
three years shares of Common Stock representing an aggregate of at least 3% of the Company’s
outstanding shares of Common Stock, may nominate and include in the Company’s proxy materials
