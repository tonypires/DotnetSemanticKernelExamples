• restrict us from paying dividends or making distributions on our capital stock or purchasing or redeeming
our capital stock.
8Consolidation, Merger and Sale of Assets
The Indentures provide that we may consolidate with or merge with or into any other person, and may sell,
transfer, or lease or convey all or substantially all of our properties and assets to another person; provided that the
following conditions are satisfied:
• we are the continuing entity, or the resulting, surviving or transferee person (the “Successor”) is a
person (if such person is not a corporation, then the Successor will include a corporate co-issuer of the
debt securities) organized and existing under the laws of the United States of America, any state thereof
or the District of Columbia and the Successor (if not us) will expressly assume, by supplemental
indenture, all of our obligations under the debt securities and the applicable Indenture and, for each
security that by its terms provides for conversion, provide for the right to convert such security in
accordance with its terms;
• immediately after giving effect to such transaction, no default or event of default under the applicable
Indenture has occurred and is continuing; and
• in the case of the 2013 Indenture, the trustee receives from us an officers’ certificate and an opinion of
counsel that the transaction and such supplemental indenture, as the case may be, complies with the
applicable provisions of the 2013 Indenture.
If we consolidate or merge with or into any other person or sell, transfer, lease or convey all or substantially
all of our properties and assets in accordance with the Indentures, the Successor will be substituted for us in the
Indentures, with the same effect as if it had been an original party to the Indentures. As a result, the Successor may
exercise our rights and powers under the Indentures, and we will be released from all our liabilities and obligations
under the Indentures and under the debt securities.
For purposes of this covenant, “person” means any individual, corporation, partnership, limited liability
company, joint venture, association, joint-stock company, trust, unincorporated organization or government or any
agency or political subdivision thereof or any other entity.
Events of Default
Each of the following events are defined in the Indentures as an “event of default” (whatever the reason for
such event of default and whether or not it will be voluntary or involuntary or be effected by operation of law or
pursuant to any judgment, decree or order of any court or any order, rule or regulation of any administrative or
governmental body) with respect to the debt securities of any series:
(1) default in the payment of any installment of interest on any debt securities of such series for 30 days
after becoming due;
(2) default in the payment of principal of or premium, if any, on any debt securities of such series when it
becomes due and payable at its stated maturity, upon optional redemption, upon declaration or
otherwise;
(3) default in the performance, or breach, of any covenant or agreement of ours in the applicable Indenture
with respect to the debt securities of such series (other than a covenant or agreement, a default in the
performance of which or a breach of which is elsewhere in the applicable Indenture specifically dealt with or that has expressly been included in the applicable Indenture solely for the benefit of a series of
debt securities other than such series), which continues for a period of 90 days after written notice to us
