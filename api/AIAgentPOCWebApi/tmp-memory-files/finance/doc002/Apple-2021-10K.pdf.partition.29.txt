facilities, subject to operating restrictions to protect public health and the health and safety of employees and customers, and it

in supply shortages that affected sales worldwide. Similar disruptions could occur in the future.
The extent of the continuing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company’s operational and financial performance is
uncertain and will depend on many factors outside the Company’s control, including the timing, extent, trajectory and duration of
the pandemic, the emergence of new variants, the development, availability, distribution and effectiveness of vaccines and
treatments, the imposition of protective public safety measures, and the impact of the pandemic on the global economy and
demand for consumer products. Refer to Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K under the heading “Risk Factors” for more information.
