Epic Games
Epic Games, Inc. (“Epic”) filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (the “Northern California
District Court”) against the Company alleging violations of federal and state antitrust laws and California’s unfair competition law
based upon the Company’s operation of its App Store. The Company filed a counterclaim for breach of contract. On September
10, 2021, the Northern California District Court ruled in favor of the Company with respect to nine out of the ten counts included
in Epic’s claim, and in favor of the Company with respect to the Company’s claims for breach of contract. The Northern California
District Court found that certain provisions of the Company’s App Store Review Guidelines violate California’s unfair competition
law and issued an injunction. Epic appealed the decision. The Company filed a cross-appeal and is seeking a stay of the
injunction pending appeal.
