the three years in the period ended September  25, 2021, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “financial

Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission

required to be independent with respect to Apple Inc. in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules
and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to

examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
