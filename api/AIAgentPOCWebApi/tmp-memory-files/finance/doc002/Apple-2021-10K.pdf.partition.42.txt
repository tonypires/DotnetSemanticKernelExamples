right to receive, on a when-and-if-available basis, future unspecified software upgrades relating to the software bundled with
each device. The Company allocates revenue and any related discounts to these performance obligations based on their relative
SSPs. Because the Company lacks observable prices for the undelivered performance obligations, the allocation of revenue is
based on the Company’s estimated SSPs. Revenue allocated to the delivered hardware and bundled software is recognized
when control has transferred to the customer, which generally occurs when the product is shipped. Revenue allocated to the
product-related bundled services and unspecified software upgrade rights is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis
over the estimated period they are expected to be provided. Cost of sales related to delivered hardware and bundled software,
including estimated warranty costs, are recognized at the time of sale. Costs incurred to provide product-related bundled
services and unspecified software upgrade rights are recognized as cost of sales as incurred.
For certain long-term service arrangements, the Company has performance obligations for services it has not yet delivered. For
these arrangements, the Company does not have a right to bill for the undelivered services. The Company has determined that
any unbilled consideration relates entirely to the value of the undelivered services. Accordingly, the Company has not recognized
revenue, and has elected not to disclose amounts, related to these undelivered services.
For the sale of third-party products where the Company obtains control of the product before transferring it to the customer, the
Company recognizes revenue based on the gross amount billed to customers. The Company considers multiple factors when
determining whether it obtains control of third-party products including, but not limited to, evaluating if it can establish the price of
the product, retains inventory risk for tangible products or has the responsibility for ensuring acceptability of the product. For
third-party applications sold through the App Store and certain digital content sold through the Company’s other digital content
stores, the Company does not obtain control of the product before transferring it to the customer. Therefore, the Company
accounts for such sales on a net basis by recognizing in Services net sales only the commission it retains.
The Company has elected to record revenue net of taxes collected from customers that are remitted to governmental authorities,
with the collected taxes recorded within other current liabilities until remitted to the relevant government authority.
