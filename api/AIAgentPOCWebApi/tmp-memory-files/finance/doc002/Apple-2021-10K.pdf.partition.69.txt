Ranking
The Notes are our senior unsecured indebtedness and rank equally with each other and with all of our other
senior unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness from time to time outstanding. However, the Notes are
structurally subordinated to any indebtedness and preferred stock, if any, of our subsidiaries and are effectively
subordinated to any secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness.
Claims of the creditors of our subsidiaries generally have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of such
subsidiaries over the claims of our creditors, including holders of the Notes. Accordingly, the Notes are effectively
subordinated to creditors, including trade creditors and preferred stockholders, if any, of our subsidiaries. The
Indentures do not restrict our ability or that of our subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness.
