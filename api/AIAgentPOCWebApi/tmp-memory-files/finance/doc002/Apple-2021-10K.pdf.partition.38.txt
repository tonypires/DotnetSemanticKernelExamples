Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Basis of Presentation and Preparation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Apple Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries (collectively “Apple”
or the “Company”). Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. In the opinion of the Company’s
management, the consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments, which are normal and recurring in nature, necessary
for fair financial statement presentation. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in
conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the amounts reported. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. Certain prior period amounts in the
consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been reclassified to conform to the current period’s

Company’s fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019 spanned 52 weeks each. Unless otherwise stated, references to particular years,
