Company for the period June 2003 through December 2014. Irish legislative changes, effective as of January 2015, eliminated
the application of the tax opinions from that date forward. The recovery amount was calculated to be €13.1 billion, plus interest of
€1.2 billion. The Company and Ireland appealed the State Aid Decision to the General Court of the Court of Justice of the
European Union (the “General Court”). On July 15, 2020, the General Court annulled the State Aid Decision. On September 25,
2020, the European Commission appealed the General Court’s decision to the European Court of Justice. The Company
believes that any incremental Irish corporate income taxes potentially due related to the State Aid Decision would be creditable
against U.S. taxes, subject to any foreign tax credit limitations in the Act.
On an annual basis, the Company may request approval from the Irish Minister for Finance to reduce the recovery amount for
certain taxes paid to other countries. As of September 25, 2021, the adjusted recovery amount was €12.7 billion, excluding
interest. The adjusted recovery amount plus interest is funded into escrow, where it will remain restricted from general use
pending the conclusion of all legal proceedings. Refer to the Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities section of Note
3, “Financial Instruments” for more information.
Note 6 – Leases
The Company has lease arrangements for certain equipment and facilities, including retail, corporate, manufacturing and data
center space. These leases typically have original terms not exceeding 10 years and generally contain multiyear renewal
options, some of which are reasonably certain of exercise. The Company’s lease arrangements may contain both lease and
nonlease components. The Company has elected to combine and account for lease and nonlease components as a single lease
component for leases of retail, corporate, and data center facilities.
Payments under the Company’s lease arrangements may be fixed or variable, and variable lease payments are primarily based
on purchases of output of the underlying leased assets. Lease costs associated with fixed payments on the Company’s operating
leases were $1.7 billion and $1.5 billion for 2021 and 2020, respectively. Lease costs associated with variable payments on the
Company’s leases were $12.9 billion and $9.3 billion for 2021 and 2020, respectively. Rent expense for operating leases, as
previously reported under former lease accounting standards, was $1.3 billion in 2019.
The Company made $1.4 billion and $1.5 billion of fixed cash payments related to operating leases in 2021 and 2020,
respectively. Noncash activities involving right-of-use (“ROU”) assets obtained in exchange for lease liabilities were $3.3 billion
for 2021 and $10.5 billion for 2020, including the impact of adopting FASB ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) in the first
quarter of 2020.
