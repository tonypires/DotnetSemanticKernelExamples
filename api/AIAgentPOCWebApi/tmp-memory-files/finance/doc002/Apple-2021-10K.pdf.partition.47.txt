Deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect the effects of tax credits and the future income tax effects of temporary differences
between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases,
and are measured using enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are
expected to be recovered or settled. The Company has elected to record certain deferred tax assets and liabilities in connection
with the minimum tax on certain foreign earnings created by the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “Act”).
As of September 25, 2021, the Company had $2.6 billion in foreign tax credit carryforwards in Ireland and $1.6 billion in
California research and development credit carryforwards, both of which can be carried forward indefinitely. A valuation
allowance has been recorded for the tax credit carryforwards and a portion of other temporary differences.
Uncertain Tax Positions
As of September 25, 2021, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $15.5 billion, of which $6.6 billion, if
recognized, would impact the Company’s effective tax rate. As of September 26, 2020, the total amount of gross unrecognized
tax benefits was $16.5 billion, of which $8.8 billion, if recognized, would have impacted the Company’s effective tax rate.
The aggregate change in the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits, which excludes interest and penalties, for 2021, 2020
and 2019, is as follows (in millions):
2021 2020 2019
Beginning balances $ 16,475 $ 15,619 $ 9,694

The Company is subject to taxation and files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and many state and foreign
jurisdictions. Tax years after 2015 for the U.S. federal jurisdiction, and after 2014 in certain major foreign jurisdictions, remain
subject to examination. Although the timing of resolution and/or closure of examinations is not certain, the Company believes it is
reasonably possible that its gross unrecognized tax benefits could decrease in the next 12 months by as much as $1.2 billion.
