Accounts Receivable
Trade Receivables
The Company has considerable trade receivables outstanding with its third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers,
resellers, small and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and government customers. The Company generally does
not require collateral from its customers; however, the Company will require collateral or third-party credit support in certain
instances to limit credit risk. In addition, when possible, the Company attempts to limit credit risk on trade receivables with credit
insurance for certain customers or by requiring third-party financing, loans or leases to support credit exposure. These credit-
financing arrangements are directly between the third-party financing company and the end customer. As such, the Company
generally does not assume any recourse or credit risk sharing related to any of these arrangements.
As of both September 25, 2021 and September 26, 2020, the Company had no customers that individually represented 10% or
more of total trade receivables. The Company’s cellular network carriers accounted for 42% of total trade receivables as of
