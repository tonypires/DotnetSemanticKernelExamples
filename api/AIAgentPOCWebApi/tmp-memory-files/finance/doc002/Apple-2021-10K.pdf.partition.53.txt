The Company offers an iPhone Upgrade Program, which is available to customers who purchase a qualifying iPhone in the U.S.,
the U.K. and China mainland. The iPhone Upgrade Program provides customers the right to trade in that iPhone for a specified
amount when purchasing a new iPhone, provided certain conditions are met. The Company accounts for the trade-in right as a
guarantee liability and recognizes arrangement revenue net of the fair value of such right, with subsequent changes to the
guarantee liability recognized within net sales.
Concentrations in the Available Sources of Supply of Materials and Product
Although most components essential to the Company’s business are generally available from multiple sources, certain
components are currently obtained from single or limited sources. The Company also competes for various components with
other participants in the markets for smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and accessories. Therefore, many
components used by the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide
shortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations.
The Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced by
the Company often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new
technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have
increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if suppliers decide to
concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company’s requirements.
The Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components; however, there can be no guarantee that the
Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all.
Substantially all of the Company’s hardware products are manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located primarily in
Asia, with some Mac computers manufactured in the U.S. and Ireland.
Unconditional Purchase Obligations
The Company has entered into certain off–balance sheet commitments that require the future purchase of goods or services
(“unconditional purchase obligations”). The Company’s unconditional purchase obligations primarily consist of payments for
content creation, Internet and telecommunications services and supplier arrangements. Future payments under noncancelable
unconditional purchase obligations having a remaining term in excess of one year as of September 25, 2021, are as follows (in
millions):

The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and that have not been fully resolved. The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. When a loss related to a legal proceeding or claim
is probable and reasonably estimable, the Company accrues its best estimate for the ultimate resolution of the matter. If one or
more legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts above management’s expectations, the
