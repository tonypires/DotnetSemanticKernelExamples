The Last Hope
The Cylons were relentless. They had hunted down the human survivors across the galaxy,
destroying their ships and colonies with their superior firepower and technology. They had a
plan, and they would not stop until they had wiped out the last remnants of their creators.
But the humans had a hope. A hope that was born from a prophecy, a legend, a myth. A hope
that there was a thirteenth colony, a lost world that had been the original home of humanity. A
hope that they could find Earth.
The only thing standing between them and their destiny was the Battlestar Galactica, an old
warship that had survived the first Cylon war and the surprise attack that had decimated the
human fleet. Led by Commander William Adama, a veteran of the first war, and President Laura
Roslin, a former secretary of education who had assumed office after the death of the previous
president, the Galactica protected a ragtag fleet of civilian ships that carried the last 50,000
humans in existence.
Along the way, they faced many challenges and enemies, both external and internal. They had to
deal with Cylon infiltrators who looked and acted like humans, some of whom even believed they
were human. They had to cope with dwindling resources, political unrest, religious conflicts, and
personal dramas. They had to make difficult decisions that tested their morals and ethics. They
had to fight for their survival and their freedom.
But they also found allies and friends, both among themselves and among other races. They
discovered new worlds and new mysteries. They learned more about their history and their
destiny. They witnessed miracles and wonders. They found love and faith.
They never gave up on their quest for Earth, even when it seemed hopeless or impossible. They
never gave up on each other, even when they disagreed or betrayed. They never gave up on
themselves, even when they doubted or feared.
They were the last hope of humanity. And they were not alone.
